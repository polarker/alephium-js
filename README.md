A JavaScript/TypeScript library for building decentralized applications on the Alephium platform.

You could run the following command to scaffold a skeleton project for smart contract development.

```

## Install

```
npm ci
```

## Development

### Update schemas

One first needs to update the version number of `alephium` and `explorer-backend` in `package.json`. Kindly note that one needs to check the compatibility of both OpenAPI files manually.

Typings can automatically generated using the following command:

```shell
npm run update-schemas
```

### Release

To release a new version:

```
npm version X.Y.Z
git push X.Y.Z
git push vX.Y.Z
```

## Compile

Compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript:

```
npm run compile
```

## Testing

```
npm run devnet:start // this will start a devnet for smart contract tests
npm test
```

or, to watch for changes:

```
npm run test:watch
```
